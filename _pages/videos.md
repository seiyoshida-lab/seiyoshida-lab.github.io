<p style="font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;font-size:20px;">Live-Cell Imaging of MEFs Expressing YFP–Btk-PH and CFP after Stimulated by Growth Factor (JCS 2018)</p>
<video src="../videos/video7.mp4" width="650px" autoplay=true loop=true controls></video>
Live-cell imaging of MEFs expressing YFP–Btk-PH (to detect PIP3) and CFP (as the reference of YFP signal) after stimulation by growth factor (JCS 2018). Growth factor induces "crater-like" structures called Circular Dorsal Ruffles (CDRs). Comparison of phase-contrast (left) and ratio (YFP–BtkPH/CFP) (right) images shows sustained PIP3 signal inside CDRs.<br>

Tubular lysosomes and macropinosomes were stained by TRDx (Bottom-Right) and LY (Bottom-Left), respectively. Merge image (Middle-LEFT) shows that tubular lysosomes (as black in the image) elongate the structure to fuse with macropinosomes (white).<br>

Comparison of phage (left) and ratio (right) images. As a probe protein to identify PIP3,<br>
YFP-BtkPH (and CFP as the reference) is expressed in macrophages. The cells were stimulated<br> 
with MCSF. The merged image (middle) shows that PIP3 is transiently generated during<br>
macropinocytosis (red color in the image).<br>

Time-lapse images of macrophage macropinocytosis. After macrophage-colony stimulating<br>
factor (MCSF), the cells induce membrane ruffles, some of which convert to macropinocytosis.<br>

Time-lapse images of a COS7 cell infected by Shigella flexneri (Yohisda et al., Science 2006). <br>
Shigella can move in the infected cells by modulating the host cytoskeleton mechanism.<br>

The world's first Live-Cell imaging (time-lapse cine photography) by Dr. Warren Harton Lewis<br>
in 1931. An isolated mouse macrophage induces macropinocytosis.<br>
